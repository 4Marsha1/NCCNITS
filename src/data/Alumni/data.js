        chance to be involved in it and you'll get to know the importance of it laterwards. With lots of love and best wishes

        I miss those days, the drill sessions, the NIC, ATC, SSB Camps. I hope my experience serves as inspiration for many other 
        bright young cadets out there. Now it's a very reputed and respected group of NIT Silchar and I am sure it will be always 
        the heart of NIT Silchar. I wish the best to my juniors who I am sure doing their duties with full sincerity. Keep the Flag

        description: `"Have you ever got to know a b c d.... of NCC? You might not have, well that comes only after you have understood 
        this, "ONE FOR ALL, ALL FOR ONE" This is the first thing, that a cadet must learn being in NCC. This might seem easy to learn, 
        but let me tell you, it is the most difficult part to understand and most importantly practice in life. I guarantee you, at NCC 
        NITS you will get the full opportunity to develop the necessary skills to use and follow this statement. All the best for that. 
        My dear juniors, NCC is not just an organisation, it is a type of life, an honour of living in a true sense. You will realise it 
        only after you have "lived" in that organisation with your mind and body open to confront the challenges it brings to you. Here 
        at NCC NITS, you might not be realising the importance of being in such an esteemed organization, but once you leave, and join 
        the mainstream, you will get to know that soon. This NCC tag (not only name but also the qualities you have inculcated) will set 
        you apart from others. I believe NCC NITS has a lot to learn and develop in times to come, but my dear ones, you are also the one 
        responsible to hold the baton and leading from the front. I wish you all a healthy body and mind, to make the best in challenges 
        of any kind." #LongLiveNCC.`

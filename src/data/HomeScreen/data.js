        the celebration of the victory of good over evil, of progress and prosperity, 
        is an important event for all Indians. The NCC NITS family has the vision that the 
        delight of Diwali is incomplete without spreading it to others. Keeping this in mind, 
        cadets from various parts of the country came together and organized <strong>Diwali Donation 
        Drive</strong> wherever possible. The drive involved cadets visiting various schools, orphanages, 
        old age homes and distributing stationary items, books, food packets, earthen lamps, chocolates 
        and many more. Apart from donating, they also spent some time with children and elders, 
        had a conversation about various topics including their lives, motivated the little children, 
        received the wisdom of elders and created some really pleasant memories.`

        Away from all the academics, and pressures of life; camp days give the greatest amount of fun and at the same time, 
        prepare us to be better versions of ourselves. For the B certificate cadre, which was for   3 days, cadets had 
        to report at GC college at 7 am.  The camp began with warm up exercises which was followed by drill practice. All 
        the basic drills were performed and commands were executed. The atmosphere was energetic due to everyone’s echoing 
        Ek Do Ek. The second day again begins with PT and drills. This was followed by the cadets being taught about the basics 
        of rifles, firing positions and techniques, first aid and many more. On the third day, everyone was taken to Masimpur 
        station firing ground, where cadets did firing practice with the 0.22mm deluxe rifle. 
        The three days were amazing and taught a lot about being together and supporting each other`

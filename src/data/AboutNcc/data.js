    content: `The National Cadet Corps (NCC) is the youth wing of the Indian Armed Forces 
        escorted by its headquarters in New Delhi, India. It plays a vital role as India’s second 
        line of defense. It is open to school and college students voluntarily as a Tri-Services 
        Organization, comprising the Army, the Navy, and the Air Wing, engaged in grooming the young 
        lads of the country into disciplined and patriotic citizens. The NCC is a youth development 
        movement and has enormous potential for nation-building. The Cadets are designated with basic 
        military training in small arms and drills. The officers and cadets have no obligation for active 
        military service once they complete their course but are given preference over common candidates 
        during selections based on their achievements in the corps.`,

    content: `The National Cadet Corps in India was formed with the National Cadet Corps Act of 1948. 
        It was raised on 15 July 1948. The National Cadet Corps can be considered as a successor of the University 
        Officers Training Corps (UOTC) which was established by the British in 1942. During World War II, the UOTC 
        never came up to the expectations set by the British. This led to the idea that some better organizations 
        should be formed, which could train more young men in a better way, even during peace times. A committee headed 
        by Pandit H.N. Kunzru recommended a cadet organization to be established in schools and colleges at a national level. 
        The National Cadet Corps Act was accepted by the Governor General and on 15 July 1948 the National Cadet Corps came into existence.<br/>
        <br/>
        During the 1965 and 1971 wars with Pakistan, NCC cadets were the second line of defence. They organised camps to assist 
        the ordnance factories, supplying arms and ammunition to the front, and also were used as patrol 
        parties to capture the enemy paratroopers. The NCC cadets also worked hand in hand with the Civil 
        Defence authorities and actively took part in rescue work and traffic control. After the 1965 and 1971 Indo-Pak 
        wars the NCC syllabus was revised. Rather than just being the second line of defence, NCC syllabus laid a greater 
        stress on developing qualities of leadership and Officer-like qualities. The military training which the NCC cadets 
        received was reduced and greater importance was given to other areas like social service and youth-management.`,
